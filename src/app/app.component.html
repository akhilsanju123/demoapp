<h1>Information of RX 100 </h1>
<p id="h1 ">The Yamaha RX 100 was a two-stroke motorcycle made by Yamaha from 1985 to 1996 with technical collaboration and distributed in India by the Escorts Group. At the initial stage, Yamaha Japan was exporting all bikes from Japan to India. After 1990, Escorts started production in India, with some parts being imported from Japan.<br><br>The RX100 designation was originally used in certain markets for the five-speed, short-stroke 97cc Yamaha RS100DX produced from 1977. This was an RS100 (itself a 1976 improvement upon the design of the original reed-valved 96cc RS100 that was introduced to the United Kingdom in September, 1974, and to the USA in November, 1974)[1][2] with a front disc brake and a tachometer, and was replaced in 1983 with the square-stroke, 98cc RX-S (with part numbers coded 31J),[3] a major update on the RS design (with substantial changes particularly to the cylinder, head, and induction, and the points ignition replaced by Yamaha Capacitor Discharge Ignition) which was to form the basis of the Escort-distributed variants including the EY-100 Escort Yamaha 100. The Escort variants of the RX-S had heavier gauge steel tubing and other changes specific to the Indian market, including slotted screws instead of the original Phillips. Names of older variants of the RS line were re-used for Escort variants of the RX-S, including RX100 and RX-Z (a designation first used for a version of the first-generation RS100 updated with Capacitor Discharge Ignition</p>

<h1>!! Conclusion !!</h1>
<p>The Yamaha RX 100 production run lasted from November 1985 to March 1996. The model was followed by the 132 cc RX G. The RX G had an economy-minded engine configuration with the ports tuned to increase fuel-efficiency and decrease exhaust gas. This model was the reply to the stricter emissions controls, which were to continue affecting Yamaha's designs. The Japanese manufacturers responded in late 1997 with the Yamaha RX-135 and the RX-Z which had a tachometer and a sportier headlamp and body. Both were mechanically the same and the RX-135 received a lukewarm response. The market also saw five-speed versions of the RX-135s and RX-Z. The final variant was a four-speed RX 135 with a small type catalytic converter, sporting a fuel gauge and a speedometer with white dials which was sold very briefly in 2003â€“2005.<br>
